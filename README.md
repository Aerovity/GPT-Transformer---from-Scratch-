# 🚀 GPT Transformer - From Scratch

Welcome to the **GPT Transformer - From Scratch** repository! This project is a comprehensive guide to building a Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT) model from the ground up. 🛠️

## 📂 Project Structure

- **`bigram.py`**: Script implementing a Bigram language model. 📄
- **`gpt.py`**: Core implementation of the GPT model. 🧠
- **`gpt_fromScratch.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook detailing the step-by-step process of constructing the GPT model. 📘
- **`input.txt`**: Sample input text file for training and testing the model. 📝

## 🛠️ Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Aerovity/GPT-Transformer---from-Scratch-.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd GPT-Transformer---from-Scratch-
   ```
3. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python and the necessary libraries installed. You can use `pip` to install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
   Launch Jupyter Notebook and open `gpt_fromScratch.ipynb` to follow the detailed guide and execute code cells interactively. 🖥️
